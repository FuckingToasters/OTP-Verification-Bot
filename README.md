5sim.net is a service, that offer you temp phonenumbers for otp verification. 
It include a lot of countries you can choose from. 
I might add vak-sms.com as this is the cheapest solution at the moment!
The Project use the API to get numbers, check for verifycodes & more. It is added within a discordbot and uses slashcommands
Slashcommands working similar to usual ones but are more integraded within Discord so typing / will suggest possible avaible commands and shows what args are needed
Its more easy to use then using a custom prefix like ! and run a helpcommand to list all commands. It is secure and will only show the responses on your side in a hidden embed.
This embed will only be shown to you so its not possible for the owner to login into the bot and see the secret stuff. 
You can run these commands in Guilds or DMs with no risk of the data being leaked

I am looking for Suggestions to keep this Project updated. Any suggestion or feature you might want me to add you can tell me by clicking on issues and choose the suggestion. Or you can use the Discordlink above to suggest things. i try to be more active, push out more opensouce projects and so on. I like to help you guys out with anything that is related to coding on my Discordserver.)
